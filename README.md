# countries
A React application in which one can look at data of various countries and the weather report for the capital of a chosen country.

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

If you clone this app, you'll need your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/ for the app to show the weather report.

This app is my implementation of exercises 2.12-2.14 on https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server. It's not perfect but I put in a lot of effort and I'm proud of how creative I got with it.
